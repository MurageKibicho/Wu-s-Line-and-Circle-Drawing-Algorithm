<h1>Wu's Line Drawing and Circle Drawing Algorithm in C</h1>
This repository implements the 1991 paper, "An Efficient Anti-Aliasing Technique" in the C programming language for LeetArxiv.

The full coding guide is available at this [link.](https://leetarxiv.substack.com/p/an-efficient-anti-aliasing-technique)

You can run this code using gcc
```
 clear && gcc main.c -lm -lgmp -o m.o && ./m.o
```
